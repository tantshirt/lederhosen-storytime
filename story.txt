One sunny afternoon in Berlin, a competitive Lederhose salesman named Klaus discovered that his prize Bratwurst had been stolen from the Baeckerei on Hauptstrasse.
Desperate to recover it, he jumped into his Porsche and raced to the Flughafen, hoping to catch the culprit.
What he didn't expect was to find a Hund wearing Dirndel leading to Schloss Eltz, where Rammstein was performing a concert in a Biergarten.
The Klimaanlage was broken, Gebaeck was everywhere, and someone had ordered way too much Doener.
As Klaus surveyed the chaos with his Apfelkuchen in hand, he realized this was going to be a long story.
Suddenly, Klaus realized with a start that he was underdressed for this kind of story, so he rushed to the nearest schloss to get dirndel to match the hund.
Klaus wanted to return to the Biergarten but knew, with the klimmanlage on the fritz, it would be too warm, so instead went to the Ratskeller, where it was naturally cooler.
Klaus, comforted by the cool ratskeller, finally started to doze off, his belly full of bratwurst he found cached in Hund's dirndel pocket.
Upon awaking, he found himself at the flughafen with no idea how he got there!
Looking around, he saw a place selling doener next to the gate heading for Berlin.
He wandered inside to see if anyone could help solve the mystery of how he got back to the flughafen.
Klaus, looking for an employee to help, spotted an oddly familiar dirndel.
It was the hund.
Still very confused, Klaus vaugely remembered the hund dragging him into the the passenger seat of his porsche, before jumping into the drivers seat.
Klaus, not remebering much more, questioned if the hund somehow drove him from the ratskeller.
